## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'd like to continue my css journey towards grid, because I feel the grid could be a better option for more structured layouts. But that will do for the current one ðŸ˜‰

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's video about flexbox](https://youtu.be/u044iM9xsWU) - This helped me to obtain how the flexbox works.
